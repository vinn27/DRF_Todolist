# __*To-Do List Application*__


The To-Do List Application is a web-based tool designed to help users manage their tasks effectively. Built using **_Django_** for the backend and **MySQL** for data storage, this application offers features such as secure user authentication, task creation, viewing, updating, and deletion. The frontend is designed with HTML, CSS, and **Bootstrap** to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface.

To get started, clone the repository and set up a virtual environment. Install the required dependencies and configure the MySQL database settings in the Django settings.py file. Apply the necessary migrations, create a superuser, and run the development server to access the application in your browser.

For containerization, Docker can be used to build and run the application in a container. Ensure that MySQL is also running and accessible to the container for a seamless experience.

The application provides several RESTful API endpoints for task management, including retrieving tasks for a user, creating new tasks, updating existing tasks, and deleting tasks.
