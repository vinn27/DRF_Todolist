# To-Do List Application

The To-Do List Application is a web-based tool designed to help users manage their tasks effectively. Built using Django for the backend and MySQL for data storage, this application offers features such as secure user authentication, task creation, viewing, updating, and deletion. The frontend is designed with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface.

To get started, clone the repository and set up a virtual environment. Install the required dependencies and configure the MySQL database settings in the Django `settings.py` file. Apply the necessary migrations, create a superuser, and run the development server to access the application in your browser.

For containerization, Docker can be used to build and run the application in a container. Ensure that MySQL is also running and accessible to the container for a seamless experience.

The application provides several RESTful API endpoints for task management, including retrieving tasks for a user, creating new tasks, updating existing tasks, and deleting tasks.
